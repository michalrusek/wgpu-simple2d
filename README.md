# Current state
All goals were reached. I don't expect any more work being done on this. It was meant to be a simple demo for getting some experience with ECS in Rust and wgpu.  
Some gif showing it off:

# Open questions
4. Deno for scripts maybe?
6. HOW TO RENDER RESOLUTION RATIOS OTHER THAN 16:9??
7. Tilesets rendering?
  
# Plan?
- It's a platformer with one level
- You can run and jump and that's it
- You can collect coins
- Timer runs down from 300s and one coin = +1s
- At the end a screen shows the score (the time)
